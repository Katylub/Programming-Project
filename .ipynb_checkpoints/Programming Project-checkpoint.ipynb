    "- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four diﬀerent variables.\n",
    "- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",

    "As mentioned the main variable to study will be the life expectancy (media) and will be taken as the first and most interesting variable for this Project purpose. I will evaluate 4 countries as demographic sample and will assign a number to each country from 1 to 4, so this will be the second variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following variable will give more information about the relation between life and income and will be evalauated the economy per capita.\n",

    "The other two variables measure the health force impact in life expectancy and the variables I took in consideration where the goverment expenditure and a the density of health professionals have in each contry for this matter.\n",

    "The countries that I choose have in general similar expectancy mean, and by coincidence I realised the other variables were similar as well, therefore I choose to add uniform random data.\n",
