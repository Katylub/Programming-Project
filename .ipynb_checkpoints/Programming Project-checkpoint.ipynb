    "This project concerns the simulation and creation of a real-world phenomenom dataset and compare the variables on it, using python packages as Numpy.In the project will be covered the academical requested points below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four diﬀerent variables.\n",
    "- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n"
