    "- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four diﬀerent variables.\n",
    "- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n"

    "\n",
    "I have noticed that there are lots of studies on this matter and there are multiple factors including social, economics, technological, etc. that affect directly on the life expectancy and were not taken in consideration before. I have find this matter interesting and the best option for this project, I have seen life expectancy is different by gender, so I will take in consideration th variables for male and female to compare the difference, also I will evaluate the data taking in consideration 4 countries for research, and the gross income per capita. \n",

Both variables will be float numbers in line with real statistics taken from this [web](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/sdg_03_10/default/bar?lang=en)\n",
